A simple 10-pin eurorack power supply.

[Here is a link to the Tayda shopping cart](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/savecartpro/index/savenewquote/qid/6584385719).

Tayda didn't carry the DC-jack I wanted to use.  I chose this jack because it has a better physical connection to the PCB than the ones at Tayda.... who am I kidding, I chose it because it was already in KiCAD.


[Here is a link to Octopar search for the part number of the jack (PJ-063AH).](https://octopart.com/search?q=PJ-063AH&currency=USD&specs=0)

Links to pics of schematic and layout so you can see what made the gerbers.
